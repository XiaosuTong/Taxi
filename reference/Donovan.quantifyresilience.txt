This article proposes a method to quantitatively measure the resilience of transportation systems 
using GPS data from taxis. 

The method works by computing the historical distribution of pace (normalized travel times) 
between various regions of a city and measuring the pace deviations during an unusual event.

Trips are grouped by their geographic locations and times of occurrence. So a large sample of
trips can be gathered at any point in time. The city is divided into a small number, k, of 
large regions.The start zone, end zone, and departure time are used to partition all of trips 
into subsets, T_{i,j,t}. Average pace is computed for each trip subset T_{i,j,t}. Trips are 
weighted by their distance, since longer trips give more information about the state of traffic.
P_{i,j,t} = \frac{\sum_r l(r)p(r)}{\sum_r l(r)}=\frac{\sum_r u(r)}{l(r)}.
where u(r) is the travel time of trip r, l(r) is the metered length of trip r, and p(r)=u(r)/l(r)
is the pace of trip r. For a fixed value of t, all k^2 (there are k regions) distance-weighted 
average paces collectively form the mean pace vector, a.

The vehicle counts drops significantly, it is difficult to determine whether this is due to 
increased congestion or decreased demand. However, an increase in pace indicates congestion, while
a decrease in pace indicates decreased demand.

The mean pace vector a(t) has a strongly periodic weekly pattern. Author defined the reference
set Q_t for all times t. This set contains all of the mean pace vectors which occur at the same
point in the periodic pattern as a(t), except for a(t) itself. Then the expected value of the mean
pace vector \mu(t) as well as the covariance matrix \Sigma(t) can be calculated as
\mu(t) = \frac{1}{|Q_t|}\sum_{a in Q_t} a
\Sigma(t) = \frac{|Q_t|}{|Q_t|-1}(\sum_{a in Q_t} aa^T/|Q_t| - \mu(t)\mu(t)^T)
Then for each a(t), the Mahalanobis distance is calculated as M(t)
M(t) = sqrt((a(t) - \mu(t))^T\Sigma(t)^{-1}(a(t) - \mu(t)))
And the a threshold is set to be the 95% quantiles of M(t)
